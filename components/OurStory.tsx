              Why I Started HomeTown
            </h2>

              <p>
                Five years ago, I noticed something troubling in Kansas City's business community. 
                Small business owners were working harder than ever, but struggling to get their 
                message out there. They had the passion, the products, and the drive, but they 
                were missing the marketing expertise to grow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I saw business owners spending countless hours trying to figure out social media, 
                burning through budgets on ads that didn't work, and feeling overwhelmed by the 
                digital marketing landscape. They needed help, but the big agencies were too expensive, 
                and the DIY approach was costing them time they couldn't afford to lose.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when I decided to build HomeTown â€“ a marketing service that understands 
                the unique challenges of running a small business in Kansas City, because I'm 
                living it too. I'm not just a consultant; I'm your partner in growth.
